# Music_Store_Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a Music Store Database to uncover key business insights and customer trends. By solving progressively challenging SQL queries (easy â†’ moderate â†’ advanced), I demonstrated both technical expertise in SQL and the ability to translate raw data into actionable business insights.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Skills Showcased

Wrote complex SQL queries using SELECT, advanced filtering, aggregate functions, and conditional logic.

Designed queries with multi-level GROUP BY and ORDER BY to extract structured insights.

Applied JOINs, CTEs, and Subqueries to combine datasets and answer real-world business questions.

Utilized Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK) to identify top performers and trends.

Optimized queries for readability and efficiency while handling relational data.

ðŸ”¹ Business Acumen Demonstrated

Identified top-performing employees, customers, and cities to guide marketing and promotions (e.g., best city for hosting a music festival).

Analyzed spending behavior of customers to determine best customers and high-value segments.

Discovered popular music genres by country to help with localized marketing strategies.

Provided insights into artist performance and track popularity for better curation and catalog management.

Delivered results that directly align with business growth, customer engagement, and revenue optimization.

This project highlights how SQL can be leveraged not only for data extraction but also for generating strategic business insights that support decision-making.
