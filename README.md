# Music_Store_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a Music Playlist Database to help the store gain insights into its business growth by answering key analytical questions.

I have applied a wide range of SQL concepts including:
Basic and advanced SELECT queries
Aggregate functions
Multiple GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations
Advanced SQL techniques such as JOIN, CTE, and subqueries
Window functions like RANK and DENSE_RANK

The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract meaningful business insights from raw data.
